				<p>
					CareerCentric.com (“CareerCentric”) takes your privacy very seriously and has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you.

					By using the CareerCentric website, or submitting information to us by other means, you are subjecting your information to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers CareerCentric’s treatment of personal information that we collect when you are on CareerCentric’s website and when you use CareerCentric’s services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that CareerCentric does not own or control, including websites that we may link to, or to individuals that CareerCentric does not employ or manage.

				</p>

				<h4>Privacy Policy Updates</h4>

				<p>
				Due to the Internet’s rapidly evolving nature, CareerCentric may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, CareerCentric will post its updated Privacy Policy on our website located at www.careercentric.com. CareerCentric encourages you to review this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. Your continued use of this site and/or continued provision of personally identifiable information to CareerCentric will be subject to the then current Privacy Policy.
				</p>

				<h4>Information Collection</h4>

				<p>
				CareerCentric may collect or receive information about you when you register or submit information, including, but not limited to, username, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, resume and contents thereof, job search history, and any other data included in a submitted profile, resume, or search. CareerCentric also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information, ratings, reviews, questions, and answers.

Jobungo may store this information in its equipment or the equipment of third party technology providers.		
				</p>


				<h4>Use of Information</h4>
				<p>CareerCentric, or companies we partner with, may contact you based on your interests such as job postings and career development opportunities. CareerCentric’s site may require you to provide CareerCentric with contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information. CareerCentric may use your contact information to (a) send you job alerts; (b) create an account; or (c) send you information about CareerCentric and promotional material from some of CareerCentric’s partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. CareerCentric may use demographic and/or profile data, including but not limited to search history, to tailor your experience on CareerCentric’s site, show you content that CareerCentric thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences.

				To the extent you upload a resume, CareerCentric may make the resume and other personal information contained therein available to third parties, including but not limited to employers and search engines. This means that the personal information contained in your resume can be viewed by third parties and you may receive unsolicited contact from third parties unaffiliated with CareerCentric. CareerCentric will make reasonable effort to safeguard the use of your personal information by third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy. CareerCentric reserves the right to disclose any information as required by law.

				We may use other companies as necessary to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Every effort will be made to safeguard your privacy when it may be accessed by other companies, including but not limited to technology providers; however, Jobungo will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies.

				CareerCentric may use your IP address to administer our site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you, your location, and to gather broad demographic information. Nothing shall restrict CareerCentric from maintaining your data following your termination of your use of CareerCentric’s site. CareerCentric may delete your user data at CareerCentric’s sole discretion.</p>


				<h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>

We recommend that minors between the ages of 13 and 17 ask and receive permission from their parent or guardian prior to using CareerCentric or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.</p>


				<h4>Protect Yourself</h4>
				<p>CareerCentric uses automated processes and third party aggregators to collect and present information that has been created by third parties, so we cannot verify the accuracy or legitimacy of all job postings displayed on our site. We strongly encourage you to exercise caution when providing information about yourself to others online, including when you apply for jobs found on CareerCentric.


				Never provide your social security number, credit card information, bank account details, or unnecessary personal information to a potential employer. Never participate in a financial transaction of any sort with a potential employer. Always be cautious of opportunities that sound too good to be true or require you to act as a financial intermediary, particularly for an overseas person.</p>
